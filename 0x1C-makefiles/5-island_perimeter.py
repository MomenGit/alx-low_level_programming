        grid (list[list[int]]): a list of list of integers represents the grid

        int: The perimeter of the island.

    Constraints:
        - 0 represents a water zone.
        - 1 represents a land zone.
        - One cell is a square with side length 1.
        - Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
        - Grid is rectangular, with width and height not exceeding 100.
        - Grid is completely surrounded by water,
          and there is one island (or nothing).
        - The island doesn't have “lakes” (water inside that isn't connected to
          the water around the island).
